6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
- Yes we did! We designed our app for people who go the gym, because sometimes it is hard to figure out a plan when you work out!

7. Describe the two custom gestures you created.
Our 2 custom gestures were combinations of basic gestures. By doing Open Hand and Closed Hand, the user can generate a random rep number! By doing Open Hand and Pointing Hand, the user can generate a random rest number!

8. How does your app implement or follow principles of good UI design?
- Useful initial view = Home Page where all the actions are
- Error prevention = cannot make a range that isn't applicable (Min always less than Max and Min cannot be 0)
Our app is responsive because we use a grid with rows and columns. It also is colorful and we used a custom font for our title!
